This Document will help you creating your own fortrace scenario, using multi-user and anti-forensic methods with the help
    of the scenario template

1. Prerequisites
    - Set up fortrace according to the installation guide found in the documentation
    - create new folder /contrib/veracrypt and copy the veracrypt files of a portable version to it
    - create a new folder /contrib/windows utils and copy the executable of the tools SDelete (sdelete64.exe) and PSExec
        (PsExec64.exe) to it (can be downloaded for free on official Microsoft websites)

2. Preparing the environment
    - if you want to use a SMB share, prepare the files you want to use on that share
        BEST PRACTICE: Avoid spaces and special characters in your directory and file names.
         Using them may require escaping of these characters
    - set the values in the "Values to define" section. If you are not using for example SMB connections, you may ignore
        the according values
    - you may set variables, that are used more often in the section "Space for additional content".
        This can be text that should be written to a file, or paths to files
    - ensure, that the provided export directory is empty, all files stored there will be added to the final package

3. Create a scenario
    - start your scenario in the section "Scenario". An exemplary beginning and end is given there
        BEST PRACTICE: Follow the example and start your scenario with the following steps:
               1. create a new user
               2. change the context to this user
               3. reboot the system (you may want to change the time)
               4. delete the initial fortrace user with parameter "secure"
               5. call the function sc.initClean() to reduce the artifacts that may have been created during
                    template creation
    - create your scenario by either using the predefined functions of the template, or using your own ones
        (e.g. for modules currently not supported by the template)
        NOTE: All functions provided by the template can be called with "needle" as the last parameter to add the
            actions to the report (reboots and shutdowns will be added always)
    - At the end of the scenario section you have different options, how you want to finish your scenario
        1. shutdown: No cleanup is done, system is shut down and scenario finishes
        2. cleanUp(): fortrace will reduce the left artifacts like the fortrace folder on users Desktops as fas as possible
            Then the system will be shut down. Since fortrace needs this directory for the last avtive user, the files will
            remain for that one
        3. cleanUp("manual"): fortrace will reduce the left artifacts l as fas as possible. Then the scenario will pause
            until the guest is shut down manually. Change to the guest, exit the GuestAgent CMD-window and follow the
            steps provided in the uninstall_manual. Shut the guest system down after finishing
4. Finalization
    - The template will create a package after finishing the scenario, that includes the disk image as .raw file, as well
        as the report for that scenario
    - Remember to clean the export directory after finishing, if you want to use it for multiple executions
