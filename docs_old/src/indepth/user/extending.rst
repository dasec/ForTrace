Extending the User Simulation Framework
---------------------------------------

This section describes how to add new user applications to the framework.

This usually consists of providing a class for the VMMSide, the GuestSide and a class for command listing.

You can find examples at: src/fortrace/application .

Especially take a look at skeleton.py .
The module is intended to be a starting point for adding new applications.
