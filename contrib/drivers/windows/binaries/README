This directory contains the driver and userspace binaries for vmulti.
Install the certificate to the trusted certificate store and enable testsigning.
The userspace component itself needs the vc2015 runtimes.
The driver was build for Windows 7+.
If you need Windows XP support build the driver following the original instructions.

Scripts to easy deployment are provided:
prepare_driver.cmd will setup the bootoptions for testsigning.
install_driver.cmd will install and load the driver.
