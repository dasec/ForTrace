This directory contains drivers for emulation mouse and keyboard on a linux system.
These drivers expose their interfaces on the /dev directory.
The keyboard driver expects scancodes from the XT-keymap.
Refer: http://kbde.sourceforge.net/kbde/man/kbde.4.html
The mouse driver expects Mouse Systems mouse scancodes.
Refer: https://www.kryslix.com/nsfaq/Q.12.html

Set the terminal keymap to de-latin1-nodeadkeys and the xserver keymap to de.
To install the drivers do a simple make install.
Make sure that the drivers are loaded before using the fortrace framework's raw device communication.
You may need to run the DevControlServer as root since you are accessing kernel mode drivers.
The fortrace framework expects the 'set1-de.conf' file from 'src/fortrace/utility/conf' in '/etc/fortrace' directory on your distro's installation.
