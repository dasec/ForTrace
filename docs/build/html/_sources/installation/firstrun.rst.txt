After the successful installation of the fortrace framework you should test that everything works as expected.
Run *python examples/testrun2.py firefox thunderbird veracrypt*. This calls a testing script that tests all functions of
the applications provided as parameters. If this script runs without errors all applications and prerequisites are
installed correctly. The next step will be implementing your own scenarios or using the generator.
